# Learn-Typescript-Fundamentals

Restaurant Recommender:

- Let’s collaborate on a program that recommends a restaurant from a list of options. The program should use a few variables, like price range, delivery time, distance, and whether the restaurant is open in order to recommend customers the perfect spot.
The problem is that this recommendation program does not recommend much. While the program runs without any fatal JavaScript errors, it does not recommend any satiating suggestions. All we get is a disappointing 'We found 3 restaurants, the first is undefined.'.
Use your knowledge of TypeScript to fix type errors and add the missing features, so we can get customers on their way to good eats.

TypeMart:

- Welcome to our new online shop: TypeMart! We’re ready to go live… well, almost… We’re attempting to get this shop up and going, but we need your help to code a crucial piece of our online mart: the purchase flow! We think you’re the right person for the job because it’s really important to us that the purchase flow is type-safe. Currently, we are producing a few types of products, and we can’t wait to expand as we start to sell our first items. For our mart to be successful, we’ll have to calculate the correct price for shoppers, in addition to applying any specials or other charges.
